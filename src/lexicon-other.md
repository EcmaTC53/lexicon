<dd>A set of features and rules that exist inside a software program enabling interaction with it through software.
<dt>Compile Time Function Execution
<dd>When the arguments to a pure function are known at compile time the compiler can create more highly optimized code vs compilation at run time.
<dt><a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">Extensible Web Manifesto</a>
<dd>A set of principles that guides how web standards committees create and prioritize new features. These principles include:
  <ul>
    <li>Focus on adding new low-level capabilities to the web platform that are secure and efficient.</li>
    <li>Expose low-level capabilities that explain existing features, such as HTML and CSS, allowing authors to understand and replicate them.</li>
    <li>Develop, describe and test new high-level features in JavaScript, and allow web developers to iterate on them before they become standardized. This creates a virtuous cycle between standards and developers.</li>
    <li>Prioritize efforts that follow these recommendations and deprioritize and refocus those which do not.</li>
  </ul>
<dt>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
<dd>A software layer between the OS or host and the hardware that provides a standard interface for interacting with hardware components.
<dt>Internet of Things (IoT)
<dd>The universe of common devices with connectivity that allows them to send and receive data over the Internet.      
<dt>Partial Evaluation
<dd>When some arguments to a pure function are known at compile time the compiler can create more highly optimized code vs compilation at run time.
<dt>Precompile
