<dt url="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">Extensible Web Manifesto<dd>A set of principles that guides how web standards committees create and prioritize new features. These principles include:<ul><li>Focus on adding new low-level capabilities to the web platform that are secure and efficient.</li><li>Expose low-level capabilities that explain existing features, such as HTML and CSS, allowing authors to understand and replicate them.</li><li>Develop, describe and test new high-level features in JavaScript, and allow web developers to iterate on them before they become standardized. This creates a virtuous cycle between standards and developers.</li><li>Prioritize efforts that follow these recommendations and deprioritize and refocus those which do not.</li></ul>
