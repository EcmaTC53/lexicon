<dt>Application<dd>In the context of TC-53, an application is a software program designed to perform a specific function on a specific device. Applications may import libraries and providers in the form of modules.
<dt url="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-javascript-standard-library/">Built-in<dd>Built-ins are javascript modules that are bundled with the host.
<dt>Data Accuracy<dd>How close a data measurement is to it's theoretical expected output.
<dt>Data Provenance<dd>Knowing where data came from and how it arrived.
<dt>Data Timeliness<dd>A measure of data timeliness. For example, how long did that "read" command take to execute? On embedded systems this could be a few ns. On a cloud based device it could be several seconds.
<dt>Data Trustworthiness<dd>The combination of data provenance, timeliness an accuracy.
<dt>External provider<dd>A downloadable module that provides a surface API that matches the GPIO API specified by TC-53.
<dt>Implementor<dd>One who authors a provider.
<dt>Internal provider<dd>A built-in module that provides a surface API that matches the GPIO API specified by TC-53.
<dt>IOCP<dd>See I/O Class Pattern
<dt>I/O Class Pattern<dd>
<dt>Library<dd>A library provides a surface API that abstracts away the GPIO API. For example, an LED library could provide an API with the methods on(), off(), blink() and toggle() that abstract away an application developers need to interact directly with a digital IO instance.
<dt>Maximally Minimal<dd>The supposition that specifying a minimal API surface for base classes allows for greatest value realization and a reduced risk of painting oneself into a corner. A concept based on conversations around EcmaScript classes.
<dt>Module<dd>
<dt url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Normative">Normative<dd>Things that have been standardized and must be followed as a rule.
<dt url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol">Protocol<dd>A system of rules that define how data is exchanged between systems.
<dt>Provider<dd>A provider is a module that provides a surface API that matches the GPIO API specified by TC-53.

<dt>Third-Party Libraries<dd>
<dt>W3C Sensor API<dd>
