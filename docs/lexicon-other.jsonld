This creates a virtuous cycle between standards and developers.</li><li>Prioritize efforts that follow these recommendations and deprioritize and refocus those which do not.</li></ul>","inDefinedTermSet":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon/./src/lexicon-other.jsonld","url":"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/"},{"@type":"DefinedTerm","@id":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon#Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)","name":"Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)","description":"","inDefinedTermSet":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon/./src/lexicon-other.jsonld"},{"@type":"DefinedTerm","@id":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon#Internet of Things (IoT)","name":"Internet of Things (IoT)","description":"","inDefinedTermSet":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon/./src/lexicon-other.jsonld"},{"@type":"DefinedTerm","@id":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon#Partial Execution","name":"Partial Execution","description":"","inDefinedTermSet":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon/./src/lexicon-other.jsonld"},{"@type":"DefinedTerm","@id":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon#Precompile","name":"Precompile","description":"","inDefinedTermSet":"https://EcmaTC53.github.io/lexicon/./src/lexicon-other.jsonld"}]
